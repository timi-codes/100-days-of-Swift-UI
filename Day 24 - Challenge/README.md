# Day 24 : Project 3 - View and Modifier (Part Two)
We were giving some challenge to use the previous knowledge acquired in day 23 to make some modification to project 1 and project 2. [Instructions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/views-and-modifiers-wrap-up)

- Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.

- Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.

- Go back to project 2 and create a FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
