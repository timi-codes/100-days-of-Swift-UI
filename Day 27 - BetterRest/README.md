# Day 26: BetterRest Part Two

BetterRest is an app designed to help coffee drinkers to help them get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:

- When do they want to wake up?
- Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
- How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

Once we have those three values, we’ll feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed.
