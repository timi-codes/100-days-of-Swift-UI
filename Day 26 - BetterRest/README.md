# Day 26: BetterRest Part One

Overview of the new project was presented - BetterRest is a Machine Learning mobile application that predicts the hours of sleep you will
get based on the amount of cofee you take or vice versa

The Machine Learning Module uses CoreML framework built into swift based on a pretrained ML Model and uses Linear Regression for decision making. This app ask three questions from the users and generate result based on this:

- When do they want to wake up?
- Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
- How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?
